# Daniel Mateos Labrador - Resume

This project is an overview of my skills as a web developer, and the page I will use as CV or resume to apply for job opportunities.

## Sections

- Personal info (Maybe google the best qualities)
- Technical skills
  - Technologies
  - Philosophy: re-usable and clean code, testing and simplicity.
- Portfolio

- Maybe add a first section with a text like: "Let's make life easier!"; and a description:
  "Technology make us productive, turning big problems and a hassle of work into easy buttons and displays. It's like magic, a magic that gives us dignity and let us care about the important things of life: our family, buddies, passions, health and an endless list of human stuff we should give more time."
  "That's the reason I got hooked on web development; I want to be a wizard too!"
